### Hi there, I'm Murphy ðŸ‘‹ a design lead specialising in systems thinking and interface architecture

Over the past 14+ years, I've led digital transformation efforts through technically rigorous, human-centered design. I specialise in building and scaling design systems that enable consistency, clarity, and collaboration across complex product ecosystems.

My work sits at the intersection of design craft, systems thinking, and technical execution â€“ and I'm most energised when working cross-functionally to solve deep product challenges at scale.
